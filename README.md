# Predicting-Acquisitions-Indian-IT-and-ITES-industry
The growth of companies is often achieved through mergers and acquisitions (M&A), which has evolved into a more advanced process over time. Identifying potential targets for acquisition can improve the efficiency of the M&A process and aid executives in making more informed decisions. M&A has become a recent trend in India, with similar motivations to those of global companies. The Indian IT and ITES industry has played a significant role in the economy and has emerged as a major player in the world market in the past four decades. To expand their global reach, companies in the Indian IT and ITES industry are now adopting M&A as a core part of their corporate strategy. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used to predict acquisition targets based on financial variables reflecting a firm's various attributes. The analysis in this study drew upon financial and acquisition data from PROWESS, spanning the years 2000 to 2021, for IT and ITES firms in India.

The initial list of independent variables comprised 23 factors, but 6 were dropped due to insufficient data. Ultimately, 4 variables were discovered to be statistically significant using the Logistic Regression (LR) method. These variables suggest that inefficient management, higher liquidity, inefficient financial structure, and a mismatch in growth resources increase the likelihood of acquisition. To determine acquisition probability, 3 ML algorithms – Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and XGBoost – were utilized. The performance metrics, including accuracy, specificity, recall, precision, and F1 score, were superior for the ML algorithms compared to LR. XGBoost demonstrated the highest accuracy, F1 score, and recall of the ML models, while RF excelled in specificity and precision. The case study research revealed that acquisitions in the sector tend to acquire new or augment existing capabilities. Furthermore, the case study research methodology confirmed the findings from both LR and ML models. The research has uniquely contributed to the body of knowledge by focusing on acquisition prediction for Indian IT and ITES firms. However, there are limitations based on data quality and not considering cross-border acquisitions. The research can be extended to include textual analysis of management commentary to supplement the data-based analysis. The research will be valuable for various stakeholders, including academicians, investors, management personnel, and analysts.
